An attempt to convert Visual Studio project files into Makefiles,
implemented in the [Delta Language](http://www.ics.forth.gr/hci/files/plang/Delta/Delta.html).

This project is of historic value only, as it served as the main tester and usability
explorer for the delta language. The most interesting part of it is the
[util](https://github.com/mouchtaris/vcproj2make/blob/deltaide2make/deltaide2make/Util/Source/util.dsc)
source file, which numbers more than 3000 lines of code aiming to provide a sane
environment within the language.

This project is functionally useful in any way and can only be used as a reference or
learn-by-example for the language itself.

It does compile and run, nevertheless, so it is an interesting test-case for the
[delta-linux-tools](https://github.com/mouchtaris/delta-linux-tools) project.
